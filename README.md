# Discord Updater for Linux

This bash script makes it easier to install Discord with the official package, with a choice between downloading the `.deb` or `.tar.gz` version. After updating, the script provides the option to install or repair [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/), which includes support for OpenAsar.
